<h1>Task: Vehicle Route Optimization</h1>

<h2>Objective:</h2>
<p>Develop a Python script to optimize vehicle routes for 3 drivers and 17 deliveries using OR-tools. The script should process incoming data, organize deliveries into optimized routes based on pickup and drop-off locations, time windows, and prepare a response in JSON format with sequence.</p>

<h2>Note:</h2>
<p>Drivers are in the same postcode area for collection.</p>

<h2>Input:</h2>
<p>Sample data in a structured format containing information about each delivery, including order ID, collection postcode, collection time window, and stop postcode.</p>
<table border="1">
<tr>
<th>Order ID</th>
<th>Collection Postcode</th>
<th>Collection From (HH:MM)</th>
<th>Collection To (HH:MM)</th>
<th>Stop Postcode</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>EC4A 1AA</td>
<td>08:30:00</td>
<td>09:00:00</td>
<td>SW1A 1AA</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>EC4A 1AA</td>
<td>08:30:00</td>
<td>09:00:00</td>
<td>EC1A 1AA</td>
</tr>
<!-- More rows... -->
</table>

<h2>Output:</h2>
<p>A JSON response that organizes the deliveries into optimized routes for each driver.</p>

<h2>Task Details:</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Data Processing:</strong>
<ul>
